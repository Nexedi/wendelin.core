"""BigArrays are NumPy ndarray-like interface on top of BigFile memory mappings.

I.e. something like numpy.memmap for numpy.ndarray and OS files. The whole
bigarray cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for numpy arrays, but BigArray
_slices_ are real ndarrays and can be used everywhere ndarray can be used,
including in C/Fortran code. Slice size is limited by mapping-size (=
address-space size) limit, i.e. to ~ max 127TB on Linux/amd64.

Changes to bigarray memory are changes to bigfile memory mapping and as such
can be discarded or saved back to bigfile using mapping (= BigFileH) dirty
discard/writeout interface. For ZBigFile that means changes can be
discarded & saved via transactions.

For the same reason the whole amount of changes to memory is limited by amount
of physical RAM.
