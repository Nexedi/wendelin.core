"""BigArray that lives in RAM

RamArray simulates ZBigArray Api, but data lives in RAM.
Append is optimized compared to numpy append by preallocating
internal storage by 2^x+1 for every append.

Other than BigArray.resize(newshape), RamArray.resize() copies data internally
so a previously created view will not see changes made to the data after
the resize.
