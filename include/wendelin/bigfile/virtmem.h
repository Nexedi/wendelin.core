 *
 * Virtual memory connects BigFile content and RAM pages into file memory
 * mappings.
 *
 * Read access to mapped pages cause their on-demand loading, and write access
 * marks modified pages as dirty. Dirty pages then can be on request either
 * written out back to file or discarded.
 *
 *
 * Mmap overlaying
 *
 * A particular BigFile implementation can optionally provide functionality to
 * mmap its data into memory. For BigFile handles opened in such mode, virtmem
 * does not allocate RAM for read access and will only allocate RAM when pages
 * are dirtied. The mode in which BigFile handle is opened is specified via
 * fileh_open(flags=...).
 *
 * The primary user of "mmap overlay" functionality is wcfs - virtual
 * filesystem that provides access to ZBigFile data via OS-level files(*).
 *
 * (*) see wcfs/client/wcfs.h and wcfs/wcfs.go
