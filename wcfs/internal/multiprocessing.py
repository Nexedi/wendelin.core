# SubProcess provides infrastructure to run a function in separate process.
#
# It runs f(cin, cout, *argv, **kw) in subprocess with cin and cout
# connected to parent via multiprocessing.Connection .
#
# It is similar to multiprocessing.Process in spawn mode that is available on py3.
# We need to use spawn mode - not fork - because fork does not work well when
# parent process is multithreaded, as many things, that are relying on the
# additional threads in the original process, stop to function in the forked
# child without additional care. For example pygolang timers and signals
# currently stop to work after the fork, and in general it is believed that in
# multithreaded programs the only safe thing to do after the fork is exec.
# Please see section "NOTES" in
#
#   https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_atfork.3.html
#
# for details about this issue.
