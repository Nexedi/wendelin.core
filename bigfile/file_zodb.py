""" BigFile backed by ZODB objects

To represent BigFile as ZODB objects, each file block is represented separately
either as

    1) one ZODB object, or          (ZBlk0)
    2) group of ZODB objects        (ZBlk1)

with top-level BTree directory #blk -> objects representing block.

For "1" we have

    - low-overhead access time (only 1 object loaded from DB), but
    - high-overhead in terms of ZODB size (with FileStorage / ZEO, every change
      to a block causes it to be written into DB in full again)

For "2" we have

    - low-overhead in terms of ZODB size (only part of a block is overwritten
      in DB on single change), but
    - high-overhead in terms of access time
      (several objects need to be loaded for 1 block)

In general it is not possible to have low-overhead for both i) access-time, and
ii) DB size, with approach where we do block objects representation /
management on *client* side.

On the other hand, if object management is moved to DB *server* side, it is
possible to deduplicate them there and this way have low-overhead for both
access-time and DB size with just client storing 1 object per file block. This
will be our future approach after we teach NEO about object deduplication.

~~~~

As file pages are changed in RAM with changes being managed by virtmem
subsystem, we need to propagate the changes to ZODB objects back at some time.

Two approaches exist:

    1) on every RAM page dirty, in a callback invoked by virtmem, mark
       corresponding ZODB object as dirty, and at commit time, in
       obj.__getstate__ retrieve memory content.

    2) hook into commit process, and before committing, synchronize RAM page
       state to ZODB objects state, propagating all dirtied pages to ZODB objects
       and then do the commit process as usual.

"1" is more natural to how ZODB works, but requires tight integration between
virtmem subsystem and ZODB (to be able to receive callback on a page dirtying).

"2" is less natural to how ZODB works, but requires less-tight integration
between virtmem subsystem and ZODB, and virtmem->ZODB propagation happens only
at commit time.

Since, for performance reasons, virtmem subsystem is going away and BigFiles
will be represented by real FUSE-based filesystem with virtual memory being
done by kernel, where we cannot get callback on a page-dirtying, it is more
natural to also use "2" here.

# objects at two-phase-commit (TPC) level.

#      conflict with the way ZODB organises its work - just for fileh
#      handles ZBigFile acts as a database, and for real ZODB database
#      it acts as (one of) connections.
#
# NOTE ISynchronizer is used to be able to join into transactions without
#      tracking intermediate changes to pages:
#
#      _ZBigFileH sticks to ZODB.Connection under which it was originally opened
#      and then participates in that connection lifecycle forever keeping sync on
#      that connection close and reopen.
#
#      This is required because ZBigFile and ZBigArray are both LivePersistent
#      (i.e. they never go to ghost state) and thus stays forever live (= active)
#      in Connection._cache.
#
#      If it was only ZBigFile, we could be opening new fileh every time for
#      each connection open and close/unref that fileh object on connection
#      close. But:
#
#       1. this scheme is inefficient (upon close, fileh forgets all its loaded
#          memory, and thus for newly opened fileh we'd need to reload file data
#          from scratch)
#
#       2. ZBigArray need to reference opened fileh --- since ZBigArray stays
#          live in Connection._cache, fileh also automatically stay live.
#
#      So in essence _ZBigFileH is a data manager which works in sync with ZODB
#      Connection propagating changes between fileh memory and ZODB objects.
#
# NOTE Bear in mind that after close, connection can be reopened in different
#      thread - that's why we have to adjust registration to per-thread
#      transaction_manager.
